# The content of the task

Processor scheduling in distributed systems (processor assignment for a process) - simulation of algorithms: random, maximum threshold, minimum threshold.

Compare CPU load, number of requests sent, number of process migrations.

# Solution

I have decided to represent the distributed distributedSystem as a undirected graph of processors:

The algorithms are running a loop until every process is resolved.

In every processor the processes are resolved using ROT algorithm.
