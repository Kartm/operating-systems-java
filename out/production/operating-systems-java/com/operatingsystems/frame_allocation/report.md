# The content of the task

Frame allocation algorithms for multiple processes - simulation of algorithms: random, proportional, processor fault frequency, working set.

Compare their numbers of generated processor faults.

# Solution

I'm generating random amount of processes with random size and random processors.

The size of the distributedSystem is hard-coded to 128 units.

The minimum size of a process is 2 units.

# Conclusions

### Proportional & working-set

These two perform the worst.

I expected the latter to be the most performant, but probably due to random generation of the data it works very similarly to the proportional algorithm (working-set utilizes the properties of locality which I do not generate in my code).

### Random

For a small number of processes this algorithm works better than the proportional and can be considered as a replacement for more complicated algorithms.

### Page fault count

I observed that this algorithm works the best in case of random data.
